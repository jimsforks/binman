The goal of this vignette is to describe the basic functionality of the 
`binman` package.

## Introduction

`binman` (Binary Manager) is an R package that allows the user to manage
the downloading of third party binaries. The downloading of binaries is
split into three parts: the pre-download, the download and the 
post-download. Each part of the download is controlled by an appropriate 
function: predlfunction, dlfunction and postdlfunction respectively.

### Pre-Download Function

The pre-download function should return upto its final point a named list 
of data.frames. The name of each data.frame corresponds to a "platform". 
Each individual data.frame should be composed of three columns namely
"version", "url" and "file". This named list of data.frames can then be 
passed to the `assign_directory` function. 

```
mypredl_fun <- function(...){
# code to return named list of data.frames
  assign_directory(mynamedlist, "myappname")
}
```

#### How directories are assigned

Directories are assigned using the `rappdirs` package. See `rappdirs::user_data_dir`
for more OS specific information.

### Download Function

The download function should take as its primary input the output given by 
`assign_directory` that is a named list of data.frames with column names
"version", "url", "file", "dir" and "exists". 

### Post-Download Function
